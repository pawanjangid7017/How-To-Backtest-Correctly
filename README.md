**Over 90% of backtested strategies fail in live trading.** This framework gives you the mathematical tools to know *before* you deploy.

## Why This Framework Exists

Most quant traders and asset managers commit the same fatal mistakes:

- They **overfit** strategies to historical noise and mistake it for signal
- They use **broken cross-validation** that leaks future information into training data
- They evaluate performance with a **naive Sharpe Ratio** that ignores multiple testing bias
- They label data using **fixed-time horizons** that ignore realistic market microstructure

**AFML-Framework** implements the complete scientific pipeline from Lopez de Prado's research to eliminate these pitfalls and build strategies that actually survive in production.

> *"Backtesting while researching is like drinking and driving. Do not research under the influence of a backtest."* -- Marcos Lopez de Prado

## Key Features

| Feature | What It Solves | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Triple-Barrier Method** | Replaces naive fixed-horizon labels with path-aware, realistic labeling | Ready |
| **Meta-Labeling (Corrective AI)** | Splits side prediction from size/confidence -- dramatically improves F1-score | Ready |
| **Purging & Embargoing** | Eliminates information leakage in time-series cross-validation | Ready |
| **Combinatorial Purged CV (CPCV)** | Generates thousands of backtest paths instead of one fragile walk-forward test | Ready |
| **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)** | Corrects for multiple testing bias -- the #1 cause of false discoveries | Ready |
| **Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO)** | Quantifies the exact probability your strategy is curve-fitted | Ready |
| **Minimum Track Record Length** | Tells you how much data you *actually* need before trusting a result | Ready |

## Core Modules

### 1. The Two Laws of Quantitative Research

Before writing a single line of code, internalize these principles:

- **The First Law:** Focus efforts on researching *theories*, not backtesting trading rules. Feature importance is a research tool; backtesting is only for validation.
- **The Second Law ("Drinking and Driving"):** Never run a backtest until your model is fully specified. Backtesting while researching guarantees overfitting.

### 2. Labeling & Sizing: Triple-Barrier and Meta-Labeling

Stop using naive labels like "did price go up after 10 days?" -- they ignore the price path and real stop-out conditions.

- **Triple-Barrier Method:** Labels observations based on the *first barrier touched*:
  - Upper barrier (profit-taking)
  - Lower barrier (stop-loss)
  - Vertical barrier (max holding period)

- **Meta-Labeling (Corrective AI):** A two-model architecture that separates *direction* from *conviction*:
  - **Primary Model:** Decides the side (Long/Short) based on economic theory or a base strategy
  - **Secondary Model (Meta-Model):** Predicts whether the primary model will be *correct*, outputting a bet size between 0 and 1. Low confidence = skip the trade, preserve capital.

### 3. Data Splitting: Eliminating Information Leakage

Financial data is NOT independent and identically distributed (IID). Standard K-Fold CV and Walk-Forward are fundamentally broken for time series.

- **Purging:** Remove any training observation whose label overlaps in time with test set labels. Prevents the model from peeking at future outcomes.
- **Embargoing:** Remove a buffer of training data immediately *after* the test set to account for feature memory (e.g., ARMA processes).

### 4. The Backtest Engine: Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)

Walk-Forward testing is dangerous -- it tests only a *single* historical path, making it trivially easy to overfit to one sequence of events.

**CPCV solves this by:**
1. Dividing time-series data into N sequential, non-overlapping groups
2. Generating ALL possible combinations of train/test splits
3. Applying Purging and Embargoing to every split
4. Producing **thousands of backtest paths** instead of one

**Result:** Instead of a single fragile Sharpe Ratio, you get the *entire distribution* of strategy performance across simulated market regimes.

### 5. Statistical Inference: Deflating the Sharpe Ratio

The standard Sharpe Ratio is broken. It assumes IID Normal returns and ignores how many strategies you tried before finding "the one."

- **Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR):** Adjusts for non-normal returns (skewness, kurtosis) and short samples. Frames the result as a probability.
- **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR):** The gold standard. Corrects for Selection Bias under Multiple Testing by adjusting for:
  - Number of trials attempted (N)
  - Variance across simulated Sharpe Ratios
  - Sample length (T)
  - Return distribution shape (skewness & kurtosis)
- **Minimum Track Record Length (MinTRL):** The minimum number of observations needed to statistically confirm a strategy's Sharpe Ratio is above zero.

### 6. Strategy Evaluation & Overfitting Detection

- **Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO):** Using CPCV results, calculates the probability that your "optimal" in-sample configuration will underperform out-of-sample. **If PBO > 0.05, reject the strategy.**
- **Transaction Cost Integration:** Every backtest must include realistic slippage, commissions, and market impact models.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neyt/AFML-Framework.git
cd AFML-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
from afml import TripleBarrier, MetaLabeling, CPCV, DeflatedSharpe

# 1. Label your data properly
labels = TripleBarrier(close, events, pt_sl=[1, 2], min_ret=0.01)

# 2. Apply meta-labeling for bet sizing
meta_labels = MetaLabeling(primary_model, features, labels)

# 3. Validate with CPCV (not walk-forward!)
cpcv = CPCV(n_groups=10, k_test=2, purge_pct=0.01, embargo_pct=0.01)
results = cpcv.run(model, features, meta_labels)

# 4. Check if your strategy is real
dsr = DeflatedSharpe(results.sharpe_ratios, n_trials=100)
print(f"Deflated Sharpe Ratio: {dsr.value:.3f}")
print(f"Probability of Backtest Overfitting: {results.pbo:.2%}")
```
